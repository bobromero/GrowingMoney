that was a very good experience

now i will get a random idea and implement it somehow

1. long term investment
2. space
3. pirates
4. waves (DONE)

waves are added and cool

now I want to add a exlposion power up

im thinking like a bullet that hurts everything in a big area2d that is calculated on impact

I have added the explosion, now i need to make the power up

I would want the power up to also have an arrow pointing to the powerup so you know it is there

power ups could be a system, I will do this in time

I can make a good camera that follows the player

game is fun actually, maybe add a time slow as a variant to the dash?
